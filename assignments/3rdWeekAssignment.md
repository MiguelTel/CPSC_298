# 3rd Week Assignment
With the 3rd week assignment I got my first experience with using v0.
I thhough it was a really interesting tool from the video of coding an
app in 1.5 hours. From what I learned the better the prompt, the better
the output will be. This tool will probably help engineers more with design
rather than code, while also cutting down time. I also got more
familiar with git and mark down.
