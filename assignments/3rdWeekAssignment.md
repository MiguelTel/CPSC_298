# 3rd Week Assignment
With the 3rd week assignment I got my first experience with using v0.
I thhough it was a really interesting tool from the video of coding an
app in 1.5 hours. From what I learned the better the prompt, the better
the output will be. This tool will probably help engineers more with design
rather than code, while also cutting down time. I also got more
familiar with git and mark down.

# 5th Week Assignment
With the 5th week assignment I became more familiar with using aider. It amazes me
how much easier it makes coding things. I also learned a bit more about Node JS and
React. One thing I wanted to do but didn't have enough time was to actually implement.
A weather api feature so the search bar will actually function. Other than that, I didn't 
do that many changes. There is still a lof of room in improvement. I can see why someone
was able to make an application in just "67" minutes from the video we watched.These tools
will greatly benefit developers as long as that developer knows what they are doing.
